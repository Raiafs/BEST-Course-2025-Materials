    "- The libraries we are using already provide certain features. You can check what features are extracted automatically with the libraries in the last blocks of this notebook.\n",
    "- Certain features are statistical. We can use numpy to perform statistical operations on properties of the signal to acquire them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the script below we have examples of both techniques, so let's unerstand what we are doing:\n",
    "1. First, we extract working_data and measures from the signal, by processing it using heartpy.\n",
    "2. In measures, we have features such as the Heart Rate (hr), pnn20 and sd1.\n",
    "3. From working_data, we work with the RR_list, where we have a list that had the intervals between consecutive RR peaks, measured in miliseconds (ms).\n",
    "4. From the RR_list, we extract some statistics, sucg as the mean RR interval (mean_rr), sdsd and kurtosis.\n",
