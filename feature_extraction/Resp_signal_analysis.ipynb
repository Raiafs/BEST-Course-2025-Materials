    "Now that we have the required imports, we can extract features from the signal.\n",
    "To extract features, there are 2 approaches you can use:\n",
    "- The libraries we are using already provide certain features. You can check what features are extracted automatically with the libraries in the last blocks of this notebook.\n",
    "- Certain features are statistical. We can use numpy to perform statistical operations on properties of the signal to acquire them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the script below we have examples of both techniques, so let's unerstand what we are doing:\n",
    "1. First, we extract a processed format of the signal and its info.\n",
    "2. From the processed signal, we select the peaks list to analyse.\n",
    "3. The respiration rate is a direct feature we can extract from the info.\n",
    "4. Extract RRV from the rate signal (list with the peak intervals).\n",
    "5. Calculate the average cycle duration using the peaks list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can add and remove features according to the list of features you chose for your project."
