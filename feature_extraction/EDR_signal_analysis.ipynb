    "- The libraries we are using already provide certain features. You can check what features are extracted automatically with the libraries in the last blocks of this notebook.\n",
    "- Certain features are statistical. We can use numpy to perform statistical operations on properties of the signal to acquire them.\n",

    "1. First, we extract the signals and info of the signal, obtaining the skin conductance as a clean signal.\n",
    "2. Using the clean signal, we can calculate the average skin conductance of the signal.\n",
    "3. We can also extract the amplitude by the difference of max and min of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
