    "To extract features, there are 2 approaches you can use:\n",
    "- The libraries we are using already provide certain features. You can check what features are extracted automatically with the libraries in the last blocks of this notebook.\n",
    "- Certain features are statistical. We can use numpy to perform statistical operations on properties of the signal to acquire them.\n",
